# baselOne2024
Repo with all the slides and showcases for the potential baselOne 2024 talk

## The talk

### Title
    I like my API tests plain and raw

### Description
    API testing in plain text, with Hurl.

### What listeners can take home: 
- plain text files are great
- testing the full backend stack matters
- testing authorization and other security topics can be easy

### The session will consist of 5 parts:
- why unit tests, integration tests and are not enough.(2 min)
- how hurl closes the gap (3 min)
-  showcase with real life backend stacks (10 min)
- how to install hurl (20 seconds showing the page)
- why use hurl and not {{tool x}} and also with {{tool x}} (4 min)

### Bio

I develop software at Optravis LLC since three years across diverse domains.
In my leisure time I like to write code in Rust and Typescript for several partly finished projects.
Currently, I focus on gathering experience in Frontend Development and Identity Management.
